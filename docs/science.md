# The science, and how not to mislead with it

- **The catalogue has a hard floor at M2.0** (67 events at M2.0, 2 below). The
  M0–M3 range the researcher first asked for does not exist in this source.
  Going below the catalogue needs waveform-level detection, not more scraping.
- **Default to the maximum-curvature Mc. The goodness-of-fit estimator is wrong
  here**: the M2.0 cut-off makes it pick Mc = 2.0, which gives b ≈ 0.67 against
  0.75 with MAXC Mc = 2.3. The page shows both and says why.
- **b over time must use one fixed Mc for all windows.** A floating Mc mostly
  measures the network's detection history.
- Treat b from fewer than 50 events as unreliable. The page flags it.
- Reference figures (2026-09-18, 786 events): MAXC Mc = 2.3 → **b = 0.750 ± 0.031**,
  n = 528. 150-event windows drift from ~1.0 in mid-August to ~0.58 in
  mid-September. Tests assert these against the fixture; live values move as SGC revises.
- The drop is larger than its error bars, so it is real *in this catalogue*. But:
  small events are missed right after a M7.4 (the early windows are the least
  reliable), magnitudes mix types (MLr_1 dominates; also MLv, Mw, M), and low b is
  common for intermediate-depth sequences. **A b-value below 1 describes the
  sequence. It is not a forecast, and the page must keep saying so.**
- **Mixed magnitude types move b by more than its error bar.** SGC gives small events
  MLr_1 and most events above M4 another type (MLv, Mw). On 2026-09-19, at Mc = 2.3:
  all types b = 0.75 ± 0.03, MLr_1 only b = 0.87 ± 0.04. Neither is right: an offset
  between the scales pulls the first down, and dropping the large events pushes the
  second up. With MLr_1 only, the September slide to ~0.58 mostly disappears (it ends
  near 0.8), so that slide leans on the larger MLv events. The b card has a tab for
  each (`dominantMagType` in `core/gr.ts`); both use the all-types Mc so that only the
  magnitudes differ, and the b charts follow the tab. A proper fix is converting to
  one scale, which needs published SGC conversion relations: do not invent them.
- **There are two clusters, and depth alone separates them** (`core/clusters.ts`, cut at
  `CLUSTER_DEPTH_KM` = 70). Measured on production, 2026-09-19, 799 events: depth is bimodal
  with a near-empty gap (286 events at 40–45 km; 5, 5, 1, 6 in the four 5-km bins from 55 to
  75 km; 33–39 per bin at 80–95 km), and the groups are also apart on the map — shallow at
  4.3–4.6 N, 76.6–76.8 W under Istmina/Sipí, deep at 4.7–4.9 N, 76.2–76.5 W around the
  mainshock (itself at 103 km). Any cut from 55 to 75 km moves shallow b by 0.003 and deep b by
  0.011; a test holds that on the fixture, so if SGC's revisions ever put a population on the
  cut, it fails. 70 km is used because it is also the conventional shallow/intermediate
  boundary. No lat/lon term and no clustering algorithm: the data does not need one and the
  page could not explain it.
  - Shared Mc 2.3: shallow **b = 0.732 ± 0.031** (n = 447), deep **b = 0.816 ± 0.112** (n = 90).
    Fixture figures, which the tests pin: 0.738 ± 0.032 (n = 438) and 0.816 ± 0.112 (n = 90).
    All were recomputed independently in Python.
  - **The two b-values cannot be told apart** (Utsu 1992 test, p = 0.24; `bDifference` in
    `core/gr.ts`). The page says that in words. "Two different b-values" is not the finding.
  - **The September slide in b is inside the shallow cluster and is not a mixing artefact**:
    1.08 ± 0.07 → 0.59 ± 0.04 over its own 150-event windows, stronger than in the mixture.
    The magnitude-type caveat above still applies inside the cluster: with MLr_1 only, the
    shallow windows end at 0.82. The split does not settle that, and the page must not imply it.
  - **What really differs is activity.** The deep cluster is a finished aftershock decay: 73 of
    its 90 events ≥ Mc came in the first week, none in the sixth, and its three M ≥ 4 events were
    all over by 13 August. The shallow cluster is all of the current activity and its large
    events are becoming more frequent (20 of its 25 M ≥ 4 events since 8 September). For a reader
    who is not a seismologist this is the useful part, so the "Dos grupos de eventos" card leads
    with it and the daily-count bars are stacked by cluster.
  - **Both clusters use the Mc of the whole filtered catalogue**, like the magnitude-type tabs,
    so only the population differs. `computeClusterStats` is the one place that rule lives; the
    page, `/api/stats?cluster=` and the CLI all go through it. Never call `computeStats` on a
    cluster's own events, which would give it its own Mc. The magnitude-type tab is the same rule
    and lives in `measure` in `src/lib/scope.ts` — see [the page's scope](frontend.md#the-pages-scope). A cluster whose own maximum-curvature
    Mc is higher than the shared one gets a caution badge (b would be biased low); today both
    are 2.3.
  - The deep cluster has too few events for 150-event windows, and smaller windows (±0.11–0.16)
    say nothing a reader should act on. It gets one b with its error bar, and the chart says why.
  - "Low b is common for intermediate-depth sequences" used to be on the page as context for the
    slide. It was misplaced: the low b is in the *shallow* cluster. The caveat now describes the
    two groups instead.
- It is a mainshock–aftershock **sequence**, not a swarm. The UI says "secuencia
  sísmica"; "enjambre" would read as technically wrong to a seismologist. The repo
  name predates that.
- **A half-filled database produces a confident, wrong number.** Production once
  showed b = 0.49 because it held only the trailing 3 days. `/api/status` now
  reports `backfill: {done, total}`, and the page warns and demotes b until history
  is complete. Keep that guard whenever ingest changes.
